# macropad (using esp32)

i'm going to continue building a macropad with an esp32 by first creating a pcb and assembling it myself by hand after getting it printed from jlcpcb. i will document the progress in this repository in case i need to go back and fix a specific part or anything that requires attention to detail. 

here is what i'm hoping it will look like at the near-end stage (screenshot from yt) -
